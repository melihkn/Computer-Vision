## Project Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks related to classification tasks using deep learning models. The notebooks focus on training and evaluating models on specific datasets.

## Files

### 1. `aid_code.ipynb`
- Implements a classification neural network for the AID dataset.
- Uses Residual Networks (ResNet) for training.
- Includes preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation steps.

### 2. `ucml_code.ipynb`
- Contains code for a classification task using deep learning.
- Implements model training and evaluation procedures.
- Uses standard machine learning libraries for data handling and processing.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the desired notebook to train and evaluate the model.
